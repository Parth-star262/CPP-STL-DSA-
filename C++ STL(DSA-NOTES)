Pair:
it is a template class provided by the C++ Standard Library (<utility> header). It is used to store two heterogeneous (or same-type) values as a single unit.


Containers:

1) Vectors: 

i)push_back()   ii) emplace_back()

Difference btw push_back() and emplace_back() are:
a] Final space used = same.
b] But emplace_back() may avoid temporary memory use, making it faster and more efficient.
c] Especially useful for complex objects like classes with constructors.
